# Didact

Inspired and adapted from [Build your own React](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/).

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Install dependencies:

       npm install

## How to Run

1. Start the web server.

       npm run serve

2. Transpile `app.source.js` to `app.dist.js` with Babel for JSX.

       npm run watch

3. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080.

Additionally, on UNIX-like operating systems (Linux, Mac, Git Bash on Windows), you can run `npm start`; which runs `npm run serve` and `npm run watch` in parallel.

## Limitations

* SVG is not supported.
* Not performant for production code.
* No Fragment syntax.
